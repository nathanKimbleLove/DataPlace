            <p>Select the <b>type</b> of visualization you would like to create using the dropdown, and enter a name for your chart (Example: <i>"Average Yearly Air Travel Statistics"</i>).</p>
            <p>Next, specify the <b>label</b> and <b>units</b> you would like to use for the X and Y axes. Don't worry - you will be able to edit this later.</p>
